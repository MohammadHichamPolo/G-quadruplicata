# G-Quadruplicata: G-Quadruplex Sequence Analysis Tool

**G-Quadruplicata** is a bioinformatics web application designed for detecting potential G-quadruplexes (G4s) in DNA sequences using the **G4Hunter** algorithm. This tool offers an intuitive interface for exploring G-quadruplex structures and provides downloadable reports, plots, and sequence data.

## Features

- **Upload DNA sequences** in FASTA format.
- **Customizable analysis parameters** such as window size, score threshold, and plot color.
- **Downloadable outputs**:
  - PDF report with sequence name, plot, and scores.
  - PNG graph of the G-quadruplicata score.
  - CSV file of all sequences with corresponding scores, including sequences that scored zero.

## Workflow

1. **Upload** a DNA sequence in FASTA format.
2. **Adjust parameters** such as window size, score threshold, and plot line color.
3. **SUBMIT**.
4. **Analyze** the sequence to compute G-quadruplicata scores.
5. **Visualize** the scores using an interactive plot.
6. **Download** a PDF report, the plot as PNG, or all sequences as CSV.

### 2. CSV File Preview

After analysis, you can download a CSV file containing the sequences with their G4Hunter scores. Here's a snapshot of what the CSV might look like:

| ID | Position | length | Score | Sequence                  |
|----|----------|--------|-------|---------------------------| 
| 1  | 100      | 25     | 1.20  | TTTGGGGGTGGCTCAACCCGAGGGG |
| 2  | 101      | 25     | 1.36  | TTGGGGGTGGCTCAACCCGAGGGGG |
| 3  | 102      | 25     | 1.36  | TGGGGGTGGCTCAACCCGAGGGGGT |

*Example rows of the CSV file.*
